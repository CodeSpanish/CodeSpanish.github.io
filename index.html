          <h3><span class="lnr lnr-pencil"></span>Digital Consultancy</h3>
          <p>
            Digital is much more complex that the implementation of the latest
            shiny technology. Ultimately a digital project is about
            understanding your business and customers in order to identify
            solutions that will provide efficiency gains or a better customer
            experience. For the last 10 years my focus has been on the
            implementation of technologies that connect your operations with
            your customers.

          <h3><span class="lnr lnr-laptop-phone"></span>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            The definition of web development is simple: the building and
            maintenance of websites. However, the complexity of a web project
            will vary depending on your customers' needs and the level of
            self-service required. Over the years I have worked on projects at
            both extremes of the spectrum: a few pages of content and secure
            transaccional portals. I can help your business identify the right
            level of complexity for your needs.

          <h3><span class="lnr lnr-rocket"></span>Software Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Managing the delivery of technology projects requires skills in
            fields beyond project management. A deep understanding of
            technologies and people are key. My years of experience working with
            teams across diverse industries and technologies, combined with
            traditional and modern management practices and a pragmatic
            approach, can help successfully deliver your next project.

        <div>
          <h3><span class="lnr lnr-store"></span>Ecommerce</h3>
          <p>
            The likes of Amazon and eBay made ecommerce accessible to the
            public. However, successful online stores run their own operations
            and platforms. Building a pretty website is not enough to achieve
            this. Your back-office systems must be integrated with your online
            store to simplify your operations. I can bring together my years of
            experience working on a variety of systems including logistics,
            production planning and web platforms, to help you succeed in
            ecommerce.

          <h3>Chief Information and Technology Officer</h3>
          <p>
            Atlantis Health is a global health technology company focusing on
            improving medication adherence in people with long-term health
            conditions. Clients include pharmaceuticals such as Bayer, Novartis,
            Pfizer, and Sanofi.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined Atlantis as Head of Delivery to coordinate the delivery of
            digital solutions globally. In October 2022, I was promoted to CITO
            (a blend of CIO and CTO). In this role, I work closely with the CEO
            and secure the technology budget. Key projects in this role involved
            modernising our core product and internal systems to achieve
            ISO27001 and SOC2-certified status. I also continue to act as a
            consultant for our clients.

          <p>
            I joined Datacom as a Delivery Manager to reshape the delivery arm
            of Datacom's Digital Experience team, which had 20 staff members.
            Due to my success in increasing the productivity and quality of the
            team and establishing solid partnerships with vendors, I became the
            division's Business Unit Manager soon after. The organisation
            underwent a series of restructures in which I had to make difficult
            decisions for the team's benefit. As a result of some of these
            decisions, the design arm was moved to a separate division, but I
            still managed a solid team of engineers.
          </p>

            Clients included Auckland Airport, Barfoot & Thompson, Canon,

          <h3>Senior Consultant</h3>
          <p>
            Deloitte Digital is a successful international digital agency,
            particularly in Australia. Deloitte wanted to replicate this success
            in New Zealand. Due to my track record of delivering solutions for
            high-profile clients, I was hired to assist in building their
            delivery team.
          </p>
          <p>
            While helping the director of Deloitte Digital with pre-sales,
            presentations, and strategy, I continued to work with delivery teams
            across Australia and New Zealand. Two re-branding projects were
            highlights of this role: Australia New Zealand Chartered Accountants
            and 3News to NewsHub by Mediaworks. In both projects, I acted as
            Senior Consultant / Technical Lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this tenure, while helping establish the practice, I
            strengthened my relationships with vendors such as Sitecore,
            Kentico, and Adobe.

          <h3>Senior Analyst / Lead Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>
            My passion for digital and Cucumber's interest in my previous work at Triodent moved me to join the organisation to gain wider exposure to digital platforms. My prior experience working on the client side helped me assist customers in making practical decisions based on solid business grounds where technology is the enabler, not the goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed and implemented online solutions for high-profile New Zealand organisations such as Bayleys, Barfoot & Thompson, Mediaworks, and Trustpower.

          <h3>Senior ERP Consultant / Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>As a lecturer at the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, I worked on a community programme to consult for local businesses. Triodent was one of these businesses. Soon after working with their IT Manager to define the company's IT Strategy, I was hired to lead its implementation.
            I led the analysis and technical implementation of the company's first ERP (EPICOR 9). The project transformed the organisation by automating manual processes and providing a 360-degree view of its performance.
          </p>
          <p>As part of this transformation, we didn't work in isolation. We collaborated closely with the sales and marketing team to redesign the company's e-commerce website. The new e-commerce platform, fully integrated with the ERP system, was a joint effort that led to a significant increase in online sales from none to NZD 1+ million a year. The website not only increased sales but also reduced call centre costs.</p>

        <p>Notable achievements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Epicor 9 ERP implementation</li>
          <li>E-commerce redesign and integration with ERP</li>
          <li>Working with the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, we obtained a grant to develop an E-learning platform for training our customers and sales team. </li>

I also mentored and assessed final-year student projects and engaged in various community and local business initiatives.</p>
        <p>In my teaching role, I delivered lectures on a wide range of subjects, including Business Applications, Electronic Commerce, Multimedia and Web Development, Operating Systems, Project Planning and Control, and Systems Overview.
