            </h3>
            <p>
              Digital is much more complex that the implementation of the latest
              shiny technology. Ultimately a digital project is about
              understanding your business and customers in order to identify
              solutions that will provide efficiency gains or a better customer
              experience. For the last 10 years my focus has been on the
              implementation of technologies that connect your operations with
              your customers.

              Development
            </h3>
            <p>
              The definition of web development is simple: the building and
              maintenance of websites. However, the complexity of a web project
              will vary depending on your customers' needs and the level of
              self-service required. Over the years I have worked on projects at
              both extremes of the spectrum: a few pages of content and secure
              transaccional portals. I can help your business identify the right
              level of complexity for your needs.

            <p>
              Managing the delivery of technology projects requires skills in
              fields beyond project management. A deep understanding of
              technologies and people are key. My years of experience working
              with teams across diverse industries and technologies, combined
              with traditional and modern management practices and a pragmatic
              approach, can help successfully deliver your next project.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The likes of Amazon and eBay made ecommerce accessible to the
              public. However, successful online stores run their own operations
              and platforms. Building a pretty website is not enough to achieve
              this. Your back-office systems must be integrated with your online
              store to simplify your operations. I can bring together my years
              of experience working on a variety of systems including logistics,
              production planning and web platforms, to help you succeed in
              ecommerce.

            <p>
              Atlantis Health is a global health technology company focusing on
              improving medication adherence in people with long-term health
              conditions. Clients include pharmaceuticals such as Bayer,
              Novartis, Pfizer, and Sanofi.
            </p>
            <p>
              I joined Atlantis as Head of Delivery to coordinate the delivery
              of digital solutions globally. In October 2022, I was promoted to
              CITO (a blend of CIO and CTO). In this role, I work closely with
              the CEO and secure the technology budget. Key projects in this
              role involved modernising our core product and internal systems to
              achieve ISO27001 and SOC2-certified status. I also continue to act
              as a consultant for our clients.

              I joined Datacom as a Delivery Manager to reshape the delivery arm
              of Datacom's Digital Experience team, which had 20 staff members.
              Due to my success in increasing the productivity and quality of
              the team and establishing solid partnerships with vendors, I
              became the division's Business Unit Manager soon after. The
              organisation underwent a series of restructures in which I had to
              make difficult decisions for the team's benefit. As a result of
              some of these decisions, the design arm was moved to a separate
              division, but I still managed a solid team of engineers.

            <h3>Senior Consultant</h3>
            <p>
              Deloitte Digital is a successful international digital agency,
              particularly in Australia. Deloitte wanted to replicate this
              success in New Zealand. Due to my track record of delivering
              solutions for high-profile clients, I was hired to assist in
              building their delivery team.
            </p>
            <p>
              While helping the director of Deloitte Digital with pre-sales,
              presentations, and strategy, I continued to work with delivery
              teams across Australia and New Zealand. Two re-branding projects
              were highlights of this role: Australia New Zealand Chartered
              Accountants and 3News to NewsHub by Mediaworks. In both projects,
              I acted as Senior Consultant / Technical Lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this tenure, while helping establish the practice, I
              strengthened my relationships with vendors such as Sitecore,
              Kentico, and Adobe.

              My passion for digital and Cucumber's interest in my previous work
              at Triodent moved me to join the organisation to gain wider
              exposure to digital platforms. My prior experience working on the
              client side helped me assist customers in making practical
              decisions based on solid business grounds where technology is the
              enabler, not the goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I designed and implemented online solutions for high-profile New

            <h3>Senior ERP Consultant / Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>
              As a lecturer at the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, I worked on a
              community programme to consult for local businesses. Triodent was
              one of these businesses. Soon after working with their IT Manager
              to define the company's IT Strategy, I was hired to lead its
              implementation. I led the analysis and technical implementation of
              the company's first ERP (EPICOR 9). The project transformed the
              organisation by automating manual processes and providing a
              360-degree view of its performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of this transformation, we didn't work in isolation. We
              collaborated closely with the sales and marketing team to redesign
              the company's e-commerce website. The new e-commerce platform,
              fully integrated with the ERP system, was a joint effort that led
              to a significant increase in online sales from none to NZD 1+
              million a year. The website not only increased sales but also
              reduced call centre costs.
            </p>

                Working with the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, we obtained a grant

              conducting research on education and IT-related topics. I also

              Planning and Control, and Systems Overview. Furthermore, I played
