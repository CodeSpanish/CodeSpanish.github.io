      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <hr />
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h3>Digital Consultancy</h3>
          <p>
            Digital is much more complex that the implementation of the latest
            shiny technology. Ultimately a digital project is about
            understanding your business and customers in order to identify
            solutions that will provide efficiency gains or a better customer
            experience. For the last 10 years my focus has been on the
            implementation of technologies that connect your operations with
            your customers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            The definition of web development is simple: the building and
            maintenance of websites. However, the complexity of a web project
            will vary depending on your customers' needs and the level of
            self-service required. Over the years I have worked on projects at
            both extremes of the spectrum: a few pages of content and secure
            transaccional portals. I can help your business identify the right
            level of complexity for your needs.

          <h3>Software Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Managing the delivery of technology projects requires skills in
            fields beyond project management. A deep understanding of
            technologies and people are key. My years of experience working with
            teams across diverse industries and technologies, combined with
            traditional and modern management practices and a pragmatic
            approach, can help successfully deliver your next project.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Ecommerce</h3>
          <p>
            The likes of Amazon and eBay made ecommerce accessible to the
            public. However, successful online stores run their own operations
            and platforms. Building a pretty website is not enough to achieve
            this. Your back-office systems must be integrated with your online
            store to simplify your operations. I can bring together my years of
            experience working on a variety of systems including logistics,
            production planning and web platforms, to help you succeed in
            ecommerce.

          <h3>Chief Information and Technology Officer</h3>
          <p>
            Atlantis Health is a global health technology company focusing on
            improving medication adherence in people with long-term health
            conditions. Clients include pharmaceuticals such as Bayer, Novartis,
            Pfizer, and Sanofi.
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined Atlantis as Head of Delivery to coordinate the delivery of
            digital solutions globally. In October 2022, I was promoted to CITO
            (a blend of CIO and CTO). In this role, I work closely with the CEO
            and secure the technology budget. Key projects in this role involved
            modernising our core product and internal systems to achieve
            ISO27001 and SOC2-certified status. I also continue to act as a
            consultant for our clients.

          <h3>Business Unit Manager / Principal Consultant</h3>
          <p>
            I joined Datacom as a Delivery Manager to reshape the delivery arm
            of Datacom's Digital Experience team, which had 20 staff members.
            Due to my success in increasing the productivity and quality of the
            team and establishing solid partnerships with vendors, I became the
            division's Business Unit Manager soon after. The organisation
            underwent a series of restructures in which I had to make difficult
            decisions for the team's benefit. As a result of some of these
            decisions, the design arm was moved to a separate division, but I
            still managed a solid team of engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clients included Auckland Airport, Barfoot & Thompson, Canon,
            Contact Energy, Genesis, Southern Cross Group, Tourism New Zealand
            and more.
          </p>
