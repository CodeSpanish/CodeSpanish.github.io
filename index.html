      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div>
          <h3>Digital Consultancy</h3>
          <p>
            Digital is much more complex that the implementation of the latest
            shiny technology. Ultimately a digital project is about
            understanding your business and customers in order to identify
            solutions that will provide efficiency gains or a better customer
            experience. For the last 10 years my focus has been on the
            implementation of technologies that connect your operations with
            your customers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            The definition of web development is simple: the building and
            maintenance of websites. However, the complexity of a web project
            will vary depending on your customers' needs and the level of
            self-service required. Over the years I have worked on projects at
            both extremes of the spectrum: a few pages of content and secure
            transaccional portals. I can help your business identify the right
            level of complexity for your needs.
          </p>

          <h3>Software Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Managing the delivery of technology projects requires skills in
            fields beyond project management. A deep understanding of
            technologies and people are key. My years of experience working with
            teams across diverse industries and technologies, combined with
            traditional and modern management practices and a pragmatic
            approach, can help successfully deliver your next project.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Ecommerce</h3>
          <p>
            The likes of Amazon and eBay made ecommerce accessible to the
            public. However, successful online stores run their own operations
            and platforms. Building a pretty website is not enough to achieve
            this. Your back-office systems must be integrated with your online
            store to simplify your operations. I can bring together my years of
            experience working on a variety of systems including logistics,
            production planning and web platforms, to help you succeed in
            ecommerce.
